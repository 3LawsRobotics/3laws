- **Credentials**: 3Laws will provide a license key based on the version of Supervisor that has been purchased/downloaded.  The license key incorporates an expiration date. If a trial license was obtained, the expiration date is 60 days from the request date for the trial.
- **Robot Name**: This identifier will be different for each robot where Supervisor is installed. It should contain a name you can use to identify an individual robot. Note that each license of Supervisor is only valid for a single platform/robot.
