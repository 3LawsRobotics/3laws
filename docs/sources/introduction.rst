Introduction
============

The 3Laws Robotics supervisor is a software package that provides a control filter to insure safety without compromising performance.
In addition, the supervisor contains a diagnostic module to monitor relevant metrics for safety and performance.

In order to make the configuration and the usage of the supervisor easier, we provide a control panel, that will guide you through the configuration of the supervisor and help you visualize the supervisor's safety filter in action.
