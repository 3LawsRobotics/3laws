  The Robot Diagnostic Module (RDM) is currently in a **prototype** phase. 3Laws is expanding and maturing the suite of available metrics.

The Supervisor's RDM monitors signals and computes metrics that can be used to quantify robot safety. The computed metrics are published on ROS through topics that are available for subscription.

For a detail list of published ros topics, please refer to the :ref:`reference_ros_topics` page.
