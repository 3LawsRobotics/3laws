Getting Started
===============

The **Robot Diagnostic Module (RDM) of 3LawsRobotics** is a powerful tool to gather analytics about your robot.
It provides low level metrics such as CPU usage, signal delays but also high level safety critical metrics
like safety envelope violation, planning inconsistency or sensor damage detection.

All of these metrics can be viewed on your web browser at `3laws.app <http://3laws.app/>`_.

In order to get your account setup and use freely this RDM, please contact contact@3lawsrobotics.com

This product is still at a Beta development stage. New features are developed every month and some breaking changes can still happened.
The 3LawsRobotics Team is available to answer your question.
