The 3Laws Supervisor is designed to work in conjunction with a cloud-based server.  When you purchase the Supervisor, 3Laws will provide you with the
credentials to connect to the web-based server and with the official company
name that is used for your serivces.

- **Credentials**: 3Laws will provide you with a license key based on the version of Supervisor that you have purchased with an expiration date. If you downloaded the trial version, the expriation date is 60 days from the date when you registered for the trial.  If you have arranged with 3Laws to also use the cloud-based dashboards, the license you receive will also include the information necessary for that connection.
- **Robot Name**: This identifier will be different for each robot where you install Supervisor.  It should contain a name you can use to identify an individual robot.

The upper-right of the display contains the Rosbridge connection status (upper right), configuration for the Rosbridge (gear next to the status), and a link to this documentation.  There is an "Update Instructions" link in the lower right that brings up a reminder of the instruction to run the installer script.

The **Save** button on each page of the Control Panel should be pressed before moving on to another page.
