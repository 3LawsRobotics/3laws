The 3Laws Supervisor is designed to work in conjunction with a cloud-based server.  When you purchase the Supervisor, 3Laws will provide you with the
credentials to connect to the web-based server and with the official company
name that is used for your serivces.

- **Credentials**: 3Laws will provide you with a license key based on the version of Supervisor that you have purchased with an expiration date (60 days from request-date for trial versions).  If you have arranged with 3Laws to also use the cloud-based dashboards, the license you receive will also include the tokens for that connection.
- **Robot Name**: This identifier will be different for each robot where you install Supervisor.  It should contain a name you can use to identify an individual robot.
- **Company ID**: If you have signed up for cloud services, your company's name will be used to upload data to the servers. Please make sure that the name matches what 3Laws used to create your account.  

The upper-right of the display contains the Rosbridge connection status (upper right), configuration for the Rosbridge (gear next to the status), and a link to this documentation.  There is an "Update Instructions" link in the lower right that brings up a reminder of the instruction to run the installer script.

The **Save** button on each page of the Control Panel should be pressed before moving on to another page.
