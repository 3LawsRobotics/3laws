- **Credentials**: 3Laws will provide a license key based on the version of Supervisor that has been purchased/downloaded.  The license key incorporates an expiration date. If a trial version was downloaded, the expiration date is 60 days from the request date for the trial. If arrangements were amde with 3Laws to also use the cloud-based dashboards, the license will include the information necessary for that connection.
- **Robot Name**: This identifier will be different for each robot where Supervisor is installed. It should contain a name you can use to identify an individual robot. Note that each license of Supervisor is only valid for a single platform/robot.

The upper-right of the display contains the Rosbridge connection status (upper right), configuration for the Rosbridge (gear next to the status), and a link to this documentation. There is an "Update Instructions" link in the lower right that brings up a reminder of the instruction to run the installer script.

The **Save** button on each page of the Control Panel should be pressed before moving on to another page.
