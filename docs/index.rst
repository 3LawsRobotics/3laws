Welcome to 3Laws Supervisor
===========================

Welcome to using the **3Laws Supervisor**, a next-generation sense-and-avoid software module for ground-based mobile platforms including differential-drive, front-steered, and omni-directional wheeled and quadruped vehicles.

**Supervisor** requires ROS (Noetic) or ROS2 (Humble/Iron, Galactic/Foxy) for proper operation.  For sensing, **Supervisor** currently supports either a 2D laserscan or a list of obstacles with their locations and shapes.

.. _contact 3Laws: mailto::sales@3laws.io

**3Laws** can build sense-and-avoid or multiple other behaviors for these or other platforms.  Please `contact 3Laws`_ for information on extended and optimized Supervisor capabilities.
